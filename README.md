### Invoice Mate

- Form for adding and editing have been implemented.
- Invoice form contains seven fields: Qty, Price, Discount %, Discount, Tax %, Tax, and Total Price.
- All the field values are dependent on the other field values.
- Submitting the form will append a row in the grid that will show all the created invoices.
- All the rows in the grid should have inline edit functionality.
- Only 2 states (2 React useStates Hooks) have been used for the whole project.
